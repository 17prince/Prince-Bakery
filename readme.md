# Prince Bakery

This is a practice project(NodeJs with MongoDB ). It is basically a bakery website in which user can see bakery items and not actually order but can make a test order. This is an API based website includes all the CRUD operations. It was a fun for me while making this project. Go ahead and take a look.
